# AUTOSAR DIO Driver

## Project Description

The AUTOSAR DIO Driver is a software module designed to provide a standardized interface for digital input and output operations following the AUTOSAR protocol. This driver is intended to be used in AUTOSAR-compliant automotive software systems and provides an abstraction layer for interacting with microcontroller GPIO pins.

## Features

1-Conforms to the AUTOSAR standard for digital I/O operations.

2-Abstraction of microcontroller-specific GPIO configurations.

3-Supports digital input and output operations.

4-Easily configurable for various microcontroller platforms.
